# Android Dagger ButterKnife MVP

This is a project that is part of a 
[3-part series](https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-android-dagger-2-10-2-11-butterknife-mvp-part-1-eb0f6b970fd) 
about how to build Android applications using 
[Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) with the 
[Dagger Android extension](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/dagger-2.11/java/dagger/android), 
[Dagger Android support extension](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/dagger-2.11/java/dagger/android/support), 
[Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife), and Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern 
with support for `@Singleton`, `@PerActivity`, `@PerFragment`, and `@PerChildFragment` scopes.

## Branches

There are 2 main branches:

1. [**master**](https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/tree/master)

  - Uses regular `Activity` and `Fragment` classes with a `minSdkVersion` of 17.

2. [**master-support**](https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/tree/master-support)

  - Uses `AppCompatActivity` and support `Fragment` classes with a `minSdkVersion` of 14. 
    This branch is an extension of the **master** branch, containing all changes from **master**. 
    Take a look at PR #49 for the main diff from **master**.

**Why is the `minSdkVersion` of the non-support setup in master 17? Can it be lower?**

There are 2 main reasons why the `minSdkVersion` of the non-support setup can only as low as 17.

1. https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/pull/20/files#r133777223
2. https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/pull/29/files#r133777242

Thus, the lowest `minSdkVersion` supported for the non-support setup in **master** is 17. 
It cannot be lower.

**What about the `minSdkVersion` of the support setup in master-support? Can it be lower than 14?**

No. The *dagger.android.support* API only supports `minSdkVersion` 
[as low as 14](https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/pull/49/files#r133043880).

## Examples

This demonstrates dagger.android, Butterknife, and MVP setup using 3 examples:

1. Activity with 1 fragment.
2. Activity with 2 fragments.
3. Activity with 1 fragment with 1 child fragment.

## Walkthrough

Read the blogs for a complete walkthrough of this app:

1. Creating a project, from scratch, using the new Dagger.Android (2.11) dependency injection 
   framework with support for `@Singleton`, `@PerActivity` , `@PerFragment`, and `@PerChildFragment` scopes.

2. Using Butterknife (8.7) to replace a lot of handwritten boilerplate view binding code.

3. Restructuring the code to Model-View-Presenter (MVP) to increase testability, maintainability, 
   and scalability. *(coming soon)*
